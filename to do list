to do list: 
challenges 1-4:
	make text go away if won, end game if you get defeated
	another enemy character
	other methods like bribe (would need money array), steal, sleep
	create friend subclass
		hug, give gift etc
		isinstance()


make sure capitalising directions and fight/talk/item name etc doesn't matter
inventory? can only use items in your inventory
	array - if item is in array you can use it
this can only happen if you can pick things up in a room, so do the same for items that you did characters
	frostmourne
	cheese
	idk other stuff
